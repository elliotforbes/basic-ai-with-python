Basic AI with Python
=====================

Basic AI with Python aims to introduce you to some of the basic fields present within Artificial Intelligence using the Python programming language. We'll begin by looking at popular fields such as Graph Theory before moving our way into more advanced fields such as machine learning and neural networks.

## Why Python?

Python is one of the biggest and most popular languages on the planet due to it's simplicity. By choosing to use Python we effectively reduce the barrier to entry for some of these topics and allow ourselves to focus purely on the underlying concepts being presented.
